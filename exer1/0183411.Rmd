## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##1.Zero hypothesis h 0: Î² horsepower = 0, horsepower is not correlated with mpg. Since F-statistic value is much greater than 1 and P value is close to 0, the original hypothesis is rejected, and there is a statistically significant relationship between horsepower and mpg.
##2.The average value of MPG is 23.45, the rse of linear regression is 4.906, and the relative error is 20.9248%. The R-squared value is 0.6059, which indicates that 60.5948% of MPG can be explained by horsepower. 
##3.The linear regression coefficient is less than zero, which indicates that the relationship between mpg and horsepower is negative.

#1.Null hypothesis: assume that mpg is not related to other variables.
#2.Since F-statistic value is much greater than 1 and P value is close to 0, the original hypothesis is rejected, then mpg has a statistically significant relationship with other variables.
#3.According to the p value of each variable, the relationship of displacement, weight, year and origin was statistically significant. The energy utilization rate of automobile is increasing year by year.

```{r}

#The residual is not obvious, the multiple linear regression is not correct.
```{r}

#There are many possible outliers. As we can see from the weight chart, point 14 has very large weight without large residual.

##b With the rise of prices, sale decline, whether the mall in the suburbs has nothing to do with sales, mall sales in the United States will be more.

##d Priece and usyes can reject the null hypothesis according to p value and F-statistic.

#No weight value exceeds (P + 1) / N, indicating that there is no obvious important point.
